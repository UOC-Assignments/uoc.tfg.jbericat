# TODO: Since it was impossible to create the Unreal Engine env. binaries, we'll be running
#       AirSim by means of the Unreal Engine Editor itself:

UE4Editor /home/jbericat/Workspaces/uoc.tfg.jbericat/src/UnrealEnvironments/UE-wildfires-map_dataset-generator/LandscapeMountains.uproject

# TO-DO -> embed this on the python code and run the whole thing from "airsim_capture_environment.py"
